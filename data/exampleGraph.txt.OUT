FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\IlyaVaschillo\Documents\2024-2025\Autumn\NetMotif\NetMotif\data\exampleGraph.txt
Network type: Undirected
Number of nodes: 48299
Number of edges: 1331
Number of single edges: 0
Number of mutual edges: 1331

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

9036 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
9597824 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
9606860 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 4346105 tries were made, 3987813 were successful.
Randomization took 3.421 seconds.
Enumeration took 8.621 seconds.
