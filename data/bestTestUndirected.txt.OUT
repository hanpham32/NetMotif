FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Users\IlyaVaschillo\Documents\2024-2025\Autumn\NetMotif\NetMotif\data\bestTest.txt
Network type: Undirected
Number of nodes: 101
Number of edges: 15
Number of single edges: 0
Number of mutual edges: 15

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

29 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
33000 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
33029 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 113192 tries were made, 18113 were successful.
Randomization took 0.025 seconds.
Enumeration took 0.037 seconds.
